# Template C++ 14 (Maintenance)

This is the documentation for the _cpp14_ template for the [ApiGear](/docs/guide/intro) code generator.
This template is in maintenance mode. The development moved to template for _cpp17_ template and it is recommended to use it for new project.

It is split in several parts:

- [Quick-Start](quickstart/index.md?current-template=template-cpp14) is the easiest way to get started
- [Features](features/features.md) explains the available code generator features and their usage and purpose.
