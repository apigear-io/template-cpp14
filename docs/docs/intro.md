# Introduction

This is the documentation for the _cpp14_ template for the [ApiGear](https://docs.apigear.io/docs/start/first_steps) code generator.

It is split in several parts:

- [Quick-Start](quickstart/index.md) is the easiest way to get started
- [Features](features/features.md) explains the available code generator features and their usage and purpose.
